- Common utilities module with XOR checksum calculation

**GD32F103 Protocol Implementation (‚úÖ Complete):**
- Full command set implementation (40+ commands)
  - System control (sleep, wake, initialize, reset, restart)
  - Motor control (speed, control type, heartbeat)
  - Actuators (blower, brushes)
  - Sensors (cliff IR)
  - Peripherals (LED, lidar power, charger)
  - IMU calibration commands
- Packet encoding/decoding with sync byte detection
- CRC validation (XOR checksum)
- Status packet parsing (96-byte sensor data)
  - Battery voltage, current, charge level
  - Wheel encoder counts
  - IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope)
  - Button states and error codes
- Serial communication interface (`Gd32Serial`)
  - Automatic initialization with timeout
  - Heartbeat loop support
  - Non-blocking status packet reading
  - Firmware version query

**Delta-2D Lidar Driver (‚úÖ Complete):**
- Full protocol implementation for 3iRobotix Delta-2D lidar
- Packet parsing with measurement data extraction
- Serial communication with automatic scanning
- Data types: `LidarPoint`, `LidarScan`
