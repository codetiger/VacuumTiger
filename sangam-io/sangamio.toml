[hardware]
# Serial port configuration
gd32_port = "/dev/ttyS3"    # GD32F103 motor controller
lidar_port = "/dev/ttyS1"   # Delta-2D lidar

[robot]
# Calibration constant (measured empirically)
# Run motors at full speed (2000) and measure encoder tick rate
max_ticks_per_sec = 3000.0  # Encoder ticks/sec at full motor speed

[streaming]
# TCP bind address for publishing (outbound: telemetry + lidar)
# Use 127.0.0.1:5555 for localhost only
# Use 0.0.0.0:5555 to bind all network interfaces
tcp_pub_address = "0.0.0.0:5555"

# TCP bind address for commands (inbound: robot commands)
# Use 127.0.0.1:5556 for localhost only
# Use 0.0.0.0:5556 to bind all network interfaces
tcp_cmd_address = "0.0.0.0:5556"

# Note: Publishing rates are determined by hardware, not configured here
# - SensorUpdate: ~500 Hz (every GD32 STATUS_DATA packet from 2ms READ loop)
# - ConnectionQuality: ~1 Hz (periodic)
# - LidarScan: ~5 Hz (Delta-2D native scan rate)
# - Commands: On-demand (external processes send as needed)

[logging]
# Log level: trace, debug, info, warn, error
level = "info"

# Log output
# stdout, stderr, or file path
output = "stdout"
