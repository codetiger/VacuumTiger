# Loop Closure Test (Square Trajectory)
#
# Robot traces a square path and returns to starting position.
# This tests cumulative drift and loop closure accuracy.
#
# Starting at (3.5, 2.5) in 8m x 8m room, trace a 2m square:
# - Move 2m forward
# - Turn 90 degrees CCW
# - Repeat 4 times to return to start
#
# Note: Start position chosen to avoid obstacles:
#   - Table at (2, 2), Pillar at (6, 2), L-shape at (5, 5), Small box at (2, 6)
#
# Expected: Final pose within 15cm/5 degrees of starting pose
