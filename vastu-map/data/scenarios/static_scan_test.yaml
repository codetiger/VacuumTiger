# Static Scan Test
#
# Robot stays stationary for 5 seconds while continuously scanning.
# Uses the stop command for clean static observation.
#
# At 5Hz lidar rate, this produces ~25 scans.
# Expected: Position error < 10cm, orientation error < 5 degrees
#
# Use this to verify:
# - Feature extraction consistency
# - ICP convergence behavior
# - Map building accuracy without motion
