# Continuous Curve Drift Test
#
# Tests ICP behavior during continuous curved motion.
# Arc motion stresses ICP because the robot is constantly rotating
# while also translating, making scan-to-map matching more challenging.
#
# Expected behavior:
# - ICP should maintain convergence during curves
# - Average iterations may be higher than straight-line motion
# - No convergence failures
#
# Map: 8m x 8m medium room (using existing map)
# Path: Series of arcs creating an S-curve pattern
