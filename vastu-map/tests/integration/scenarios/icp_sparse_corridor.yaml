# ICP Sparse Corridor Test
#
# Tests ICP behavior with only parallel walls visible (degenerate geometry).
# In a narrow corridor, the robot can see both walls but rotation is
# underconstrained because all features are parallel lines.
#
# Expected behavior:
# - ICP should detect high condition number (degenerate case)
# - Position along corridor may drift
# - Rotation estimation may be unstable
#
# Map: 1m x 10m corridor
# Path: Move 3m down the corridor
