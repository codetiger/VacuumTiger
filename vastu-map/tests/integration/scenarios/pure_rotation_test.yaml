# Pure Rotation Test (360 degrees)
#
# Robot rotates in place without translation.
# This tests orientation estimation accuracy in isolation.
#
# Starting in center of room, perform 4 consecutive 90-degree turns
# to complete a full 360-degree rotation.
#
# Expected: Final orientation within 5 degrees of starting orientation (0 rad)
