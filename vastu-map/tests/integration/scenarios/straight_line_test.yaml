# Simple Straight Line Test
#
# Robot moves straight forward only, no rotation.
# This isolates any orientation issues in line extraction.
#
# Starting in center of room, facing +X (theta=0)
# Move 3m forward in a straight line

start_pose:
  x: 2.0
  y: 4.0
  theta: 0.0  # Facing right (+X)

path:
  # Move forward 3m (both wheels equal distance = straight line)
  # No rotation commands - just pure forward motion
